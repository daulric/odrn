# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### 2. Configure Supabase

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add your Supabase credentials:

   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

   You can find these values in your Supabase project settings: https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api

3. Make sure your Supabase database has a `profiles` table in the `ordn` schema with the following structure:
   - `id` (uuid, primary key) - References auth.users.id
   - `username` (text, unique) - User's chosen username
   - `avatar` (text, nullable) - Avatar URL/path
   - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Profile creation timestamp

### 3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
